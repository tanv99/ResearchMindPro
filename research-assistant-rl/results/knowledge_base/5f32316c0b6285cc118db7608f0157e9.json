  "title": "Accurate Image Super-Resolution Using Very Deep Convolutional Networks",
  "abstract": "We present a highly accurate single-image superresolution (SR) method. Our method uses a very deep convolutional network inspired by VGG-net used for ImageNet classification [19]. We find increasing our network depth shows a significant improvement in accuracy. Our final model uses 20 weight layers. By cascading small filters many times in a deep network structure, contextual information over large image regions is exploited in an efficient way. With very deep networks, however, convergence speed becomes a critical issue during training. We propose a simple yet effective training procedure. We learn residuals only and use extremely high learning rates (104 times higher than SRCNN [6]) enabled by adjustable gradient clipping. Our proposed method performs better than existing methods in accuracy and visual improvements in our results are easily noticeable.",

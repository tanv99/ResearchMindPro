  "title": "Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal\\n Networks",
  "abstract": "State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal\\nalgorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN\\nhave reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region\\nproposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region\\nProposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the\\ndetection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a\\nfully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and\\nobjectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate\\nhigh-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We\\nfurther merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their\\nconvolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural\\nnetworks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified\\nnetwork where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has\\na frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving\\nstate-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS\\nCOCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015\\ncompetitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning\\nentries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.\\n",
